# JavaScript Basics

This is the code which I have written while learning basics of JavaScript programming language. There are 9 files, which go from JavaScript basics, up to JavaScript Object Oriented Programming principles, as well as using Excel JS npm package to work with Excel files.
To install the package just use the command **npm install** to install the dependency provided in **package.json** file.
